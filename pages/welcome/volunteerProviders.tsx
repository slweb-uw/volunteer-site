              We are delighted that you are interested in working with our
              students as they serve their communities. Having qualified role
              models is a key component of our service-learning program at the
              University of Washington. Your participation is greatly
              appreciated and absolutely necessary.

              As an experienced professional you will model for our students how
              you think through a problem and how you communicate and
              collaborate with patients. The students may know some of the
              science of medicine, but not the art. You have a great deal to add
              to their education. Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and
              passion for patient care!

                Interprofessional Approach

              Many of our projects are now interdisciplinary! The development of
              interprofessional teams has the added benefit of helping learners
              understand the roles of other health professionals and their own
              place and contribution to a well-functioning health care system.

              Thank you for your interest in our programming. Sometimes we can
              get so caught up in our studies that we lose track of the reasons
              why we went into health care to begin with. Service learning can
              help. It gives us a chance to serve the less fortunate in our
              communities, identifying their inherent strengths, building on
              those. Service learning gives trainees real life opportunities to
              utilize the knowledge gained through course work and both
              actualize and reflect on our values. Scratch that itch to do
              something positive in the world!

          “Precepting can help you feel better about yourself and the world.
          This is one of the greatest positives about precepting. Taking a few
          hours to work with totally selfless health sciences students who are
          searching for ways to help the less fortunate is the best antidote to
          the COVID blues and political cynicism that I’ve found. It is a joyful
          experience. Give it a try and see if you don’t agree.”
