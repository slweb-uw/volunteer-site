              Thank you for your interest in volunteering to serve our
              communities! Sometimes we can get so caught up in our studies that
              we lose track of the reasons why we went into health care to begin
              with. Service learning can help.

            “Service Learning has helped me to get to know and build
            relationships in a community that I was new to. I have bonded with
            my classmates as I work alongside them and I have grown to
            appreciate and respect the locals in the place I now call home. What
            I love the most about this work is the inspiration I get from being
            surrounded by students and faculty who have such large hearts,
            helping hands and altruistic spirits. I can only hope to model those
            characteristics for the rest of my life.”
